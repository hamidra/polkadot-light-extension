## Adding new shadcn/ui components

In this repository we use the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Instead of exporting components like a traditional components library, this library is just a helper to generate the latest shadcn/ui components via a CLI. The see [docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for more details.

The generated components should be place in the `packages/ui/components` directory. Inside the `package/ui` project a `components.json` file describes how and where shadcn/ui should create the components. Unfortunately the configuration is a bit limited for our monorepo use-case. Therefore, the generated components need a bit of manual import path adaptation. Most often just changing the absolute import of the `utils` to a relative import like `../utils`. See already generated components for details.

```sh
pnpm shadcn-ui add <component-name>
```

After generating new components, make sure to export them from the `packages/ui/index.ts` file to import the new component easily.
